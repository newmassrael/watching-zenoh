//! `LwipTime<C>` — `impl wz_runtime_core::TimeSource` for the MCU
//! profile. R311av-pre Decision 7 finalize: own [`ClockSource`]
//! trait only; the `embedded-time` v0.13 crate has been stalled
//! since 2024 and an external ecosystem dep would surface as a
//! leaky abstraction against the composable-framework north star
//! (zero external coupling for the runtime contract). An optional
//! `embedded-time` adapter feature can land in a later round if a
//! deploy reports an ecosystem-alignment need.
//!
//! ## R311bc rework: time source borrows from runtime
//!
//! Construction sig changed from R311av:
//!
//! - R311av: `LwipTime::new(source: C)` — owned the ClockSource;
//!   `SleepFuture<'a, C>` borrowed `&'a C` directly.
//! - R311bc: `LwipTime::new(rt: &LwipRuntime<C>)` — clones the
//!   shared `Arc<RuntimeInner<C>>`; `SleepFuture<C>` is `'static`
//!   (owns the Arc) and registers its waker with the runtime's
//!   timer queue on first Pending poll.
//!
//! The breaking change is intentional. Under R311av the clock and
//! the timer source were two different physical objects (clock
//! owned by `LwipTime`, no timer source at all — sleep futures
//! self-waked). Under R311bc both live in the same
//! `Arc<RuntimeInner<C>>` so a deadline registered by one sleep
//! and a `now_us()` sample taken by `run_until_idle` necessarily
//! agree.
//!
//! ## What the deploy crate must provide
//!
//! A type implementing [`ClockSource`] — a single method
//! `now_us(&self) -> u64` that returns the current monotonic time
//! in microseconds since an impl-defined epoch. Typical sources:
//!
//! - Cortex-M: read `SysTick->VAL` against a known reload + a
//!   wraparound counter incremented by the SysTick ISR.
//! - RISC-V: read the `mtime` MMIO register against the platform's
//!   tick frequency.
//! - host tests: an `Arc<AtomicU64>` advanced manually (see
//!   `runtime_impl.rs` test module).
//!
//! The deploy passes its `ClockSource` instance to
//! [`crate::LwipRuntime::new`]; both `LwipTime` and the timer
//! queue read from that one instance via the shared `Arc`.
//!
//! ## Wake-on-deadline (R311bc) vs self-wake (R311av retired)
//!
//! [`SleepFuture::poll`] and [`TimeoutFuture::poll`] no longer use
//! the `cx.waker().wake_by_ref()` self-wake pattern. On first poll
//! that returns `Pending`, the future calls
//! `runtime.timers().register(deadline_us, cx.waker().clone())`;
//! subsequent polls (re-triggered by the inner future in the case
//! of `TimeoutFuture`) check `registered` to avoid duplicate heap
//! entries.
//!
//! The deploy `wfi()`-sleep semantics now hold: when no task is
//! ready and no timer has elapsed, the executor pass is idle, and
//! `wfi()` actually sleeps until the next IRQ (HAL timer expiry,
//! lwIP RX, etc.). Under R311av the executor's self-wake busy-poll
//! kept every pass active.
