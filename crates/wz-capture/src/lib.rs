#![no_std]

//! R311y578 (G1) — the CAPTURE-side input path wz did not have.
//!
//! wz reads from sockets. Everything under `crates/` assumes a live link it
//! opened, so consuming the same decoders over traffic wz never joined had no
//! front end at all: no capture ingest, no TCP flow reassembly, no way to map
//! a decoded message back to the packet that carried it.
//!
//! This crate is that front end, in four layers, each of which can be used
//! alone:
//!
//! | layer | module | in | out |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | capture file | [`pcap`] | file bytes | packets |
//! | decapsulation | [`link`] | a packet | a TCP segment + flow key |
//! | flow reassembly | [`tcp`] | segments | a per-direction byte stream + offset map |
//! | session | [`Dissection`] | streams | decoded zenoh messages |
//!
//! The zenoh half is NOT here — it is `wz_session_core::passive`, which knows
//! the protocol and nothing about capture. The seam between the two is a byte
//! stream plus a direction, which is also what a live tap produces, so an
//! AF_PACKET or ring-buffer source replaces [`pcap`] without touching
//! anything below it.
//!
//! `no_std` + `alloc`, with no third-party dependencies. Every format read
//! here is a fixed-layout header out of a byte slice.
