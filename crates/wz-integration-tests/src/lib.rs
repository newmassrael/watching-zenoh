//! manifested as the Layer E flake observed on the R209 / R214 push
//! hook runs (`wz_initiator_round_trip_against_wz_acceptor` and
//! `ap_demo_round_trip_against_zenoh_pico_z_put`). R216 lifts the

//! bind → child-spawn → bind-confirmed window so concurrent tests in
//! the same `cargo test` invocation cannot pick the same port.
