//! R311y664 (§1.2a) — the analyzer, as something a person can run.
//!
//! ## What was measured before this crate existed
//!
//! `Dissection::from_pcapng` had two callers in the whole workspace: one test
//! and the C ABI. Every round of this track from R311y648 on added a finding a
//! reader needs — this flow is TLS, here is how much of it there is, here is the
//! random it is keyed by, here is its plaintext — and none of them were reachable
//! without writing Rust. A library nobody can run is not an analyzer.
//!
//! ## Why the work is HERE and `main` is four lines
//!
//! Everything except opening files is in this module, taking bytes and
//! returning a string. That is what makes it testable without writing anything
//! to disk: the tests below drive whole captures and whole key logs through
//! [`analyze`] as `&[u8]`, and the binary's own job -- read two paths, print,
//! choose an exit code -- has nothing left in it to get wrong.
