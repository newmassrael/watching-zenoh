// ── Owned projection (portable native form) ───────────────────────────
// `StreamEnvelope<'a>` above is a zero-copy view borrowing the decode
// buffer. Consumers that persist a decoded value beyond the buffer's
// lifetime — including the self-contained bounded-collection that stores
// elements by value — call `.try_into_owned()` for this lifetime-free
// `StreamEnvelopeOwned`. The rkyv-style Archived(borrowed) ↔ native
// (owned) split, both generated from the one SCXML source (SSOT).
// `String` / `Bytes` fields project to the portable runtime newtypes
// `SceString<N>` / `SceBytes<N>`: an unbounded `String` / `Vec<u8>` under
// `alloc` (the on-wire protocol caps no payload, so the AP profile must
// not either — `N` is advisory) and the heap-free `heapless::String<N>` /
// `heapless::Vec<u8, N>` (the C11 `char[N]` analog) without it, where `N`
// is the hard capacity. A leaf codec's owned form therefore still compiles
// on a no-alloc MCU; only an unbounded owned `Vec` (list / embed / variant
// body) keeps the `alloc` gate. `try_into_owned` stays the fallible
// direction (one `?` per profile: the `alloc` copy cannot fail, the
// no-alloc copy enforces `N`); `as_borrowed` re-borrows either
// form infallibly via `.as_slice()` / `.as_str()`.
