// ── Owned projection (storage-parameterised native form) ─────────────
// `Fragment<'a>` above is a zero-copy view borrowing the decode
// buffer. Consumers that persist a decoded value beyond the buffer's
// lifetime — including the self-contained bounded-collection that stores
// elements by value — call `.try_into_owned()` for this lifetime-free
// `FragmentOwned`. The rkyv-style Archived(borrowed) ↔ native
// (owned) split, both generated from the one SCXML source (SSOT).
//
// The owned form is parameterised by a storage profile rather than fixed at
// build-configuration time: `FragmentOwned<Heap>` holds growable
// containers with the declared capacities advisory, `FragmentOwned<Inline>`
// holds every field inline at its declared capacity and never allocates, and
// both exist in the same binary. `FragmentOwned` alone is the build's
// default profile. Because the non-allocating profile is a *type*, this mirror
// carries no `alloc` gate at all — a list- or embed-bearing codec has an owned
// form on the heap-free tier too, and a heap-capable consumer can still pin a
// value to storage that is guaranteed not to allocate.
//
// `try_into_owned` is the fallible direction (one `?` per profile: on the
// growable profile the copy cannot fail, on the inline profile it enforces
// each declared bound); `as_borrowed` re-borrows any profile back
// into the single borrowed view that owns `encode`; `transcode_in` moves a
// value between profiles as a checked projection rather than a re-decode.
//
// Decoding picks the profile from the call (`try_into_owned_in::<Inline>()`).
// Hand-assembling one instead names it on the value or its binding —
// `let v: FragmentOwned = FragmentOwned { .. };`
// — because the fields reach the profile through its associated container
// types, which cannot be run backwards to recover the profile from a value.
// Naming it once is also what lets each field's declared capacity infer,
// so no call site repeats a `sce:max-size` / `sce:max-count` constant.
// Same pub-API policy as the borrowed view above: the owned mirror and its
// projections are cross-crate surface, and which of them a given in-repo
// fixture happens to call says nothing about their value.
